# burger

I created this app for the UCLA Coding Bootcamp MYSQL Full Stack App assignment inspired by Bob's Burger. It is connected to MYSQL to pull data and maipulate when a button is clicked.  The page is dispalyed using handlebars on the front-end.  The back-end is powered through Express and deployed through Heroku.

Getting Started

Go to the heroku website link for Devour Burgers. You can choose to eat burgers that have already been created or suggest a new burger.  The theme of burger names are burgers from Bob's Burgers.  There are two sections of the website.  One has burgers that are avialable to eat. If you click "devour it", that burger is no longer avaiable to eat and will move to the eaten section.  The burgers that have already been eaten are no longer aviable to be eaten.
